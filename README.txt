The tags generated by ctags are recognized by a wide variety of text editors, 
most notably Vi and its derivatives, but not Emacs which uses the tag file 
format generated by etags.

On large projects it is not unusual to have multi-MB tag files. One of the 
main drawbacks of etags is that the tags are not sorted so that tag lookup 
is linear and slow. Another shortcoming of using etags and Emacs is that the 
entire tag file is loaded into memory, which, when combined with the linear 
search, leads to interminable garbage collection and memory exhaustion. 
The vtags project addresses these issues. It does a binary search without 
reading the entire tag file into memory.

If there are features of etags that you would like to see carried forward
into vtags, then please let me know. Currently implemented features include
find, multiple tag files, and completion.

There are some esoteric features in etags that I don't plan
to implement unless I hear that people actually
use them. Example: nested TAGS files. What are they?

Anyone who wants a legacy feature to be carried forward
can help by providing test cases to illustrate how the
feature should work.

To run the regression tests in vtags.el, start emacs
in the Test directory:

    emacs -q -l ../regress.el -l ../vtags.el&

then
   
    M-x regress
    vtags-look-tests
    vtags-find-tests
